* Forms are used to send and store information on a server

* Responsive CSS layouts to allow for smaller screens to have a better experience

* Registering, Logging In (Authorization)

## Technologies & Techniques

**Technologies:**

* Visual Studio Code: Website code

* Figma: Layout reference for final webpage

* Git: Used to work in different branches in order to manage the development of the website's features

* Github: Keeping the code for the webpage and hosting it with Github Pages

* MongoDB: Database used for storing users and cards

* Google Compute Platform: Hosting a remote server to run the website

* Express: Back-end framework

**Techniques:**

* JSX allows writing HTML and JavaScript in the same file, allowing for an alternative way to structure and reduce code

* Instead of using selectors to get the elements from the DOM, the elements are integrated into the Javscript code

* The website uses an API to store and retrieve data from a server

* Authorization and registration are used in conjunction with protected routes to ensure that only authorized users have access to the website

* Back-end utilizes centralized error handling
